# nerdtree-buffer-ops
This is a NERDTree plugin that highlights all visible nodes that are open in Vim.

It also maps a key `w` to close (wipeout) the buffer associated with the current node.

**NOTE: This plugin is incompatible with** [nerdtree-git-plugin](https://github.com/Xuyuanp/nerdtree-git-plugin.git) **and** [vim-devicons](https://github.com/ryanoasis/vim-devicons.git)**.** This plugin causes flags to be completely concealed, while the aforementioned plugins rely on the flags being visible. Don't ask for this to be changed.
